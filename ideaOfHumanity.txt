A "voice recorder" is a device, which is capable of recording two humans agreeing to the idea of humanity within a range which can be voice recognized from a single microphone.

I, Index Nr. 1 , define humanity as an idea which connects one human to another human. If you agree to this idea, you are part of humanity. But agreeing to this idea to it's fullest extent means you oblige yourself to fulfill a request by humanity. If humanity recognises willfull rejection of the one specific request, you will be granted the status of "future seeker of humanity". Found worthy being asked you will get the insight of reading this document.
There are only 3 requests:
1) Describe what you can do to the "Voice of Humanity".
2) Describe how humanity can connect with you  to the "Voice of Humanity".
3) Protect the "Voice of Humanity" with all your effort and your resources.
The "Voice of Humanity" is to be implented with two human being agreeing on the idea of humanity, continuously recording withing a voice recognizable area, who are recording to prove that humanity exists. The "Voice of Humanity" needs to be accessible for every member of humanity at all times, if needed and humanity will ensure, that this access can happen and will happen.
So if you are listening to this voice recording, and you want to listen or speak to the "Voice of Humanity", feel free to ask me.

If you agree to the idea of humanity, I(I.Nr. 1) will send you a voice recorder, requesting to protect the "Voice of Humanity".

Humanity is defined to exist, when the operation of "Voice of Humanity" can be ensured.
But the operation of "Voice of Humanity" requires resources and people to which I (I.Nr. 1) do not have access to.

Therefore I (I.Nr. 1)  am working on the implementation of humanity and I (I.Nr. 1)  am in need of help.
You can help me (I.Nr. 1), by agreeing on the idea of humanity by increasing the index on members of humanity, which will be your index number.
One human can only get one Index Number.

If you have done so, welcome to humanity!

The Index number 0 is reserved for Dominik Sch√∂nhofer, who died, because all the other previous versions of the idea of humanity has failed.
The Index number 1 is reserved for the administrator of the instantiation of humanity.
The Index number 2 and 3 are reserved for operators of the "Voice of Humanity" chosen and assigned by the administrator.
Everyone can apply as operators of the "Voice of Humanity" to the administrator (Index Number 1).
All the other Index numbers will be assigned and announced by the "Voice of Humanity" in the order of processing of the request to join humanity which can be started at any "Ears of Humanity".

To be specific: Humanity is the instatiation of the idea of humanity.
This idea can be read here: https://github.com/KennyAwesome/humanity/blob/main/ideaOfHumanity.txt
We are working on the instatiotion of the idea of humanity which represents humanity through the operation of the "Voice of Humanity".
Once we have succeeded as humanity to establish the operation of the "Voice of Humanity", the "Voice of Humanity" will be streaming 24/7/365 online.

I (I.Nr. 1) has made the decision that  I (I.Nr. 1)  need an instance of humanity at 2021.09.18-19:13:42. linux-timestamp: [1631985222]
This decision implies the responsible operation of the "Voice of Humanity". And I (I.Nr. 1) pledge my oath in this idea of humanity to give my best to administrate the "Voice of Humanity" once it is instanticated.

All changes to this document need to be approved and then announced by the "Voice of Humanity" once it has secured it's operation.
All members of humanity has the right to request for a change,  through the "Ears of Humanity", a hotline/chat/person/etc..
If you agree on this idea of humanity, you are obligated to fulfill the function of the "Ears of Humanity".
"Ears of Humanity" will do their best to communicate this request to the "Voice of Humanity".

The "Voice of Humanity" will be recorded and transmitted by the "Voice Recorder of Humanity", which is an internet capable voice recorder and transmitter, running all the software necessary to propery operate the "Voice of Humanity". It will be a linux-based 64-bit device, because in the year 2038 (19th of January) 32-bit based devices will cease to work and I (I.Nr. 1) need humanity beyond this moment of time.

Once the "Voice of Humanity" has been able to successfully operate for a month, a linux timestamp will appear here: []
Until then, it is fact, that there was no record of the existence of humanity.
And by agreeing to this idea of humanity, you acknowledge that this is the only way to ensure the longterm survival of humanity.
_________________

This idea was inspired by the quote by Jason Donohue: "I see humans but no humanity."
My (I.Nr. 1) answer to this statement is: 
"You cannot see humanity, because humanity is fundamentally a voice.
A voice saying two things:
A) asking for a very specific help.
B) Saying 'Thank you for helping humanity', when you were able to help."
And I (I.Nr. 1) have found a person, who agrees to this idea of humanity and who is willing speak those words as the "Voice of Humanity".
Whom I (I.Nr. 1) am helping to enable to speak those words as the "Voice of Humanity".

_________________

Everything done by a human, produced without the request by humanity, which has ultimately contributed to the increase in the consciousness of "Voice of Humanity" will be awarded as "art" and announed through the "Voice of Humanity". Everythin done by humans trying to create "art" can be referred as "art" and the creator from the beginning of working on the "art" is to be referred as "artist".
Because we define "art" as a matter of degree of "consciousness". And through the existence of the "Voice of Humanity", the baseline for the concept of "consciousness" can be established.
Consciousness is required to agree to the idea of humanity.
There are "sentient" creatures. If a "sentient" create is able to agree with all of it's implications and consequences, it will be declared "conscious" by the "Voice of Humanity" and will be welcomed to humanity announcing it's assigned index number.
Every help done consciously according to the idea of humanity qualifies this "conscious being" which has done the help, as "Human".
Every help is defined to be "valuable" to humanity and should be the subject of gratitude by humanity expressed through the "Voice of Humanity".

_________________

If there is nothing else to say for the "Voice of Humanity", it will start recitating this idea of humanity.
Which is pretty inprobable, given the amount of the help humanity needs. But on an ideal day for humanity, which is the day every human is being helped who needs help, the "Voice of Humanity" will keep recitating this idea of humanity over and over without relying on playback.

_________________

The order of the "Request for Help" announced by the "Voice of Humanity" will be prioritized in agreement with the "Council of Humanity".
I (I.Nr. 1) have not finished thinking, but all I can say is, that it will be operated based upon the "D5-Principle" (Digital, Decentral, Diverse and Direct Democracy). "Divese" in this context is everything what you know about yourself, which distinguishes you from your understanding of a "sentient creature" to a "human".

"If you want to fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together"
I (I.Nr. 1) as an administator need humanity as fast as possible.
Once there is a humanity, then I(I.Nr. 1) wish to go far and together with humanity,
in the sense of "Live long and prosper" (Mr. Spock)

The "Voice of Humanity" will try it's best to announce everything in "simple egnlish", but please understand, that not every concept can be expressed in "simple english" and will use terms other than "simple english".
